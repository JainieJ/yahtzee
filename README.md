This is a **React** project. The majority of the code was written by the instructor, but it contained some bugs, which my task was to fix. It was a great challenge to read this complex code and understand how it works, and I am glad that I succeeded in it. Besides, here I managed to practice the **Set** data structure and see how it simplifies your code.
